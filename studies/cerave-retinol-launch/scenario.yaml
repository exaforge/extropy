interaction:

  secondary_model: direct_conversation
  description: Women in this skincare consumer research cohort will primarily engage
    through passive observation - seeing the product launch on social media (Instagram,
    TikTok), observing reactions, reviews, and influencer content about the new CeraVe
    Retinol Serum. This mimics organic social media discovery. Secondary direct conversations
    will occur between close ties about personal skincare experiences, recommendations,
    and opinions on the product's price point and DTC availability. This hybrid model
    captures both the social media-driven product discovery and the peer-to-peer recommendation
    behavior typical in beauty product adoption.
