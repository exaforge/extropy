  with people outside their household + Netflix announces enforcement of password-sharing
  rules: users must pay .99/month extra per shared member outside household or stop
  sharing'

intro_template: I'm a {age}-year-old {gender} living in {state}. I've been a Netflix
  subscriber for {netflix_tenure_months} months on the {netflix_subscription_type}
  plan, and I currently share my password with {num_people_sharing_with} {sharing_relationship}
  outside my household. I've been sharing for {sharing_duration_months} months now,
  and with Netflix's new enforcement requiring me to pay an extra $7.99 per person
  or stop sharing entirely, I'm trying to figure out what to do.
