  content: 'Netflix announces enforcement of password-sharing rules: users must pay
    $7.99/month extra per shared member outside household or stop sharing. This policy
    applies to all Netflix subscribers who currently share their account credentials
    with people who do not live in the same household. Subscribers will need to either
    add these outside-household members as paid "extra members" at $7.99 per month
    each, or remove their access to the account. The enforcement will require account
    holders to verify which devices are part of their household.'

interaction:
  primary_model: broadcast_response
  secondary_model: direct_conversation
  description: This is a corporate policy announcement that directly affects all 1000
    Netflix subscribers in the population. The interaction follows a broadcast_response
    pattern where Netflix makes an official announcement and subscribers react to
    it, comparing their reactions and discussing options with their network. The secondary
    direct_conversation model captures the important one-on-one discussions that will
    happen between people who are currently sharing passwords (sharing buddies, close
    family, close friends) as they need to coordinate decisions about whether to pay
    extra, stop sharing, or find alternatives. These direct conversations will be
    particularly important given the financial and relationship implications of the
    decision.
