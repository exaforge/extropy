      moderate-to-low given context of school board decisions (local institutions
      score higher than federal). Parents trust local schools more than institutions
      generally, hence moderate is peak category.

      However, 93% feel children safe in library, 82% trust librarians. Distribution
      reflects high baseline concern (55% very concerned or concerned) but not universal,
      with majority having at least moderate concern about age-appropriate content.

    source: Parent engagement research, suburban community patterns
    note: Social network density for parents correlates with community involvement
      and tenure in neighborhood. Suburban homeowners with school-age children tend
      to have moderate-to-high networks through school connections, PTA, extracurriculars.
      76% join PTA per general statistics. Longer homeownership increases network
      density. Base distribution assumes most suburban parents have moderate to high
      networks, with very high density (15%) among highly engaged, isolated (5%) among
      newcomers or low engagement.
