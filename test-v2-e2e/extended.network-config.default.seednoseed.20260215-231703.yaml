generated_from: 10 US suburban homeowners with school-age children + Local school
  board book ban decision
generation_rationale: 'This is a small, tight-knit suburban community of 10 homeowners
  with school-age children facing a contentious school board book ban decision. These
  connections will be driven primarily by:


  1. **Geographic and institutional proximity**: They''re all suburban homeowners
  in the same community, likely attending the same schools and school board meetings.
  School type (public vs private) and school board engagement are critical dividers
  and connectors.


  2. **Parenting and community involvement**: PTA membership, community involvement
  level, and school board engagement create natural connection points. Parents who
  are active in schools know each other through meetings, events, and advocacy.


  3. **Ideological alignment**: On a polarizing issue like book bans, political ideology,
  religious affiliation, parental control preferences, and LGBTQ acceptance will create
  strong homophily - people will cluster with those who share their views.


  4. **Children''s ages**: Parents with similarly-aged children meet through school
  grades, playgroups, and extracurricular activities.


  5. **Hub identification**: Highly engaged school board members and PTA members will
  be natural connectors, as will those with high community involvement and many children
  (more touchpoints with other families).


  6. **Edge types**: We''ll distinguish between close allies (share ideology + school
  type), school contacts (same school/PTA but different views), neighborhood acquaintances
  (geographic proximity), and advocacy partners (same school board engagement level).


  7. **Influence asymmetry**: School board engagement level creates authority, PTA
  membership gives influence on school matters, number of children increases network
  reach, and community involvement level drives opinion leadership.


  Given the small size (10 people) in a single suburban community around a polarizing
  issue, I expect high average degree (30-40) as people will know most others, but
  relationships will vary in quality based on alignment.'
