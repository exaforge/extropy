generated_from: 10 US suburban homeowners with school-age children + Local school
  board book ban decision
generation_rationale: '

  This is a small, tight-knit suburban community of 10 homeowners with school-age
  children centered around a local school board book ban decision. Key connection
  drivers:


  1. **Geographic & School Connections**: Since this is a suburban community with
  school-age children, the primary connection points are: state/location (they''re
  neighbors), school_type (public school parents will know each other), and school_board_engagement
  (people active in school issues will know each other). The social_network_density
  attribute directly indicates how connected people are.


  2. **Shared Interests & Activities**: PTA membership, community_involvement, and
  library_usage_frequency create natural meeting points. Parents with similar aged
  children (youngest_child_age, oldest_child_age) will connect through school activities.


  3. **Social/Political Alignment**: For a contentious issue like book bans, political_ideology,
  religious_affiliation, parental_control_preference, and lgbtq_acceptance will drive
  homophily - people cluster with like-minded individuals on polarizing topics.


  4. **Hubs**: People with high community_involvement, PTA membership, and very_active
  school_board_engagement are natural connectors. High social_network_density directly
  indicates hub status.


  5. **Edge Types**: We need to distinguish between household partners (same household),
  close neighbors (same state + high interaction), PTA connections, school board activism
  connections, and general acquaintances.


  6. **Influence**: School board engagement level (more active = more influence),
  PTA membership (gives platform), community_involvement (higher = more influence),
  and education_level (graduate degree holders may have more credibility) create asymmetry.


  7. **Average Degree**: This is a small, politically-charged community issue bringing
  people together. With only 10 people and high stakes, expect 20-35 connections per
  person as neighbors and parents interact frequently around schools and the controversial
  decision.
