    note: Household savings highly skewed (lognormal). Median US household savings
      much lower than mean. For suburban homeowners aged 35-55 with median income
      $105k, typical savings $40k-120k. Lognormal with mean $75k, high std dev captures
      wide variation.

    note: School-age childcare less expensive than infant/toddler care. Afterschool
      programs typically $200-500/child/month. Some families need no care (stay-at-home
      parent, older children), others need full afterschool care for 2+ children.
