  description: 'Nationally representative US adult population (18-80). Must capture
    the demographic, economic, and attitudinal fault lines that drive divergent responses
    to major national events — especially technology disruption, economic shocks,
    cultural controversies, and electoral behavior in the 2026 midterm elections.


    Beyond standard demographics (age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, income,
    geography), prioritize attributes that determine how people process and react
    to news, make decisions under uncertainty, and vote:


    - technology adoption posture and digital literacy (technophobe to early adopter)

    - media ecosystem and primary information sources (cable news, social media, podcasts,
    local news, none)

    - institutional trust (government, corporations, media, science, financial system)

    - financial margin and economic anxiety (savings buffer, debt load, paycheck-to-paycheck
    status)

    - employment sector and job security perception (federal/state government, private
    sector, gig, self-employed, retired)

    - consumer identity and brand relationship (brand loyal, price-driven, values-driven)

    - social media behavior and influence (passive consumer, active poster, influencer,
    non-user)

    - investment and financial literacy (no investments, 401k only, active trader,
    crypto holder)

    - religious engagement and worldview (secular, moderate, devout, denomination)

    - political identity and engagement level (strong partisan, moderate, disengaged,
    single-issue)

    - 2024 presidential vote (Trump, Harris, third party, didn’t vote, not eligible)

    - congressional district competitiveness (safe R, safe D, swing district)

    - midterm turnout propensity (always, sometimes, rarely, never)

    - issue salience for 2026 (economy/jobs, abortion/reproductive rights, immigration,
    democracy/rule of law, healthcare, climate, education, AI/technology)

    - approval of current direction (strongly approve to strongly disapprove)


    Geographic distribution should span urban/suburban/rural across major US regions
    (Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Southwest, West Coast), with realistic correlation
    structure between attributes.'
