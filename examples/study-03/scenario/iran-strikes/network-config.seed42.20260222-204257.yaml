generated_from: "Nationally representative US adult population (18-80). Must capture\

  \ cultural controversies, and electoral behavior in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\
  \nBeyond standard demographics (age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, income,\
  \ geography), prioritize attributes that determine how people process and react\
  \ to news, make decisions under uncertainty, and vote:\n\n- technology adoption\
  \ posture and digital literacy (technophobe to early adopter)\n- media ecosystem\
  \ and primary information sources (cable news, social media, podcasts, local news,\
  \ none)\n- institutional trust (government, corporations, media, science, financial\
  \ system)\n- financial margin and economic anxiety (savings buffer, debt load, paycheck-to-paycheck\
  \ status)\n- employment sector and job security perception (federal/state government,\
  \ private sector, gig, self-employed, retired)\n- consumer identity and brand relationship\
  \ (brand loyal, price-driven, values-driven)\n- social media behavior and influence\
  \ (passive consumer, active poster, influencer, non-user)\n- investment and financial\
  \ literacy (no investments, 401k only, active trader, crypto holder)\n- religious\
  \ engagement and worldview (secular, moderate, devout, denomination)\n- political\
  \ identity and engagement level (strong partisan, moderate, disengaged, single-issue)\n\
  - 2024 presidential vote (Trump, Harris, third party, didn\u2019t vote, not eligible)\n\
  - congressional district competitiveness (safe R, safe D, swing district)\n- midterm\

  \ (economy/jobs, abortion/reproductive rights, immigration, democracy/rule of law,\

generation_rationale: "This is a nationally representative US adult population simulation\
  \ focused on political behavior, media ecosystems, and responses to national events.\
  \ Let me think carefully about how these people actually connect in real life:\n\
  \n**Attribute Weights (Homophily drivers):**\n1. **us_region** - Geographic proximity\
  \ is the strongest real-world connector. People in the same region share local networks,\
  \ employers, community institutions.\n2. **urban_rural** - Urban/suburban/rural\
  \ determines entirely different social ecosystems \u2014 who you run into, what\
  \ institutions you share, what kind of community exists.\n3. **political_identity**\
  \ - Political affiliation creates strong social sorting in modern America. People\
  \ self-select into social circles with similar politics (churches, neighborhoods,\
  \ friend groups).\n4. **education_level** - Educational attainment is one of the\
  \ strongest homophily signals in American social networks \u2014 college-educated\
  \ vs. non-college defines many social boundaries.\n5. **religious_engagement** -\
  \ Religious communities are primary social hubs, especially outside urban areas.\
  \ Devout people connect with other devout people through church.\n6. **primary_info_source**\
  \ - Media ecosystem reflects and reinforces social clustering. People who consume\
  \ the same media tend to know each other.\n7. **employment_sector** - People in\
  \ the same employment sector (federal govt, private, gig, etc.) share workplace\
  \ networks and professional associations.\n8. **household_income** - Income determines\
  \ neighborhood, social activities, schools \u2014 strong homophily driver.\n9. **race_ethnicity**\
  \ - Racial/ethnic homophily remains strong in American social networks due to residential\
  \ segregation and cultural communities.\n10. **age** - Age cohort determines life\
  \ stage, social venues (schools, retirement communities, young professional groups).\n\
  11. **marital_status** - Married couples socialize with married couples; singles\
  \ form different social networks.\n12. **social_media_behavior** - Active social\
  \ media users form online communities that become real social ties.\n\n**Degree\
  \ Multipliers (Hubs):**\n- Active poster/influencer on social media = more connections\n\
  - Self-employed = more diverse business network contacts\n- Highly engaged partisan\
  \ = political organizing creates many connections\n- Early adopter / Innovator =\
  \ technology communities with high connectivity\n- Devout religious = church community\
  \ creates many ties\n\n**Edge Types:**\n- Household members \u2192 family\n- Same\
  \ region + same urban/rural \u2192 neighbor/community\n- Same employment sector\
  \ + same region \u2192 coworker/professional\n- Same political identity + high engagement\
  \ \u2192 political ally\n- Same religious engagement (devout) \u2192 faith community\n\
  \n**Influence Factors:**\n- Education level: Higher education creates more persuasive/authoritative\
  \ voice\n- Political engagement level: Highly engaged partisans influence the disengaged\n\
  - Social media behavior: Active posters/influencers push information to passive\
  \ consumers\n- Household income: Higher income signals status authority in financial\
  \ discussions\n\n**Average Degree:**\nFor a general consumer/adult population in\
  \ the US, realistic ego network sizes center around 10-20 meaningful connections.\
  \ Given the diversity of connection types (family, neighbors, coworkers, religious\
  \ community, political networks, online), I'll target 14 as a reasonable average\
  \ \u2014 reflecting a mix of close ties and acquaintances in a nationally representative\
  \ sample."
