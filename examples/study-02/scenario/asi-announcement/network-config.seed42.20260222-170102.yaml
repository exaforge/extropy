  rationale: "Social media influencers and active posters maintain large networks\
    \ by definition \u2014 they broadcast to followers, engage in comment threads,\
    \ and are sought out for opinions. This is the primary network hub mechanic in\
    \ modern America."
- attribute: political_engagement_level
  condition: Highly engaged partisan
  multiplier: 2.0
  rationale: Political activists, campaign volunteers, and party organizers have unusually
    wide networks spanning neighbors, coworkers, and fellow partisans. They attend
    events, canvass neighborhoods, and coordinate across communities.
- attribute: employment_sector
  condition: Self-employed
  multiplier: 1.8
  rationale: Small business owners and entrepreneurs must cultivate broad networks
    of clients, vendors, suppliers, and referral sources. Their livelihood depends
    on relationship breadth.
- attribute: religious_engagement
  condition: Devout
  multiplier: 1.7
  rationale: Devout individuals attend religious services regularly, participate in
    faith communities, serve on committees, and form dense congregational networks.
    Churches remain one of the most powerful community-forming institutions in America.
- attribute: employment_sector
  condition: State/local government

    \ officials, community leaders, and service recipients."
- attribute: marital_status
  condition: Married/partnered
  multiplier: 1.3
  rationale: "Married couples have dual social networks that often merge \u2014 each\
    \ partner brings their own friends, family, and colleagues, expanding the household's\
    \ total social footprint."
- attribute: has_children
  condition: true
  multiplier: 1.4
  rationale: "Parents of school-age children are embedded in school networks, sports\
    \ leagues, PTAs, and playdate circles \u2014 generating many weak and strong ties\
    \ with other parents in the same community."

  \nBeyond standard demographics (age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, income,\

  \ and primary information sources (cable news, social media, podcasts, local news,\
  \ none)\n- institutional trust (government, corporations, media, science, financial\

  \ status)\n- employment sector and job security perception (federal/state government,\
  \ private sector, gig, self-employed, retired)\n- consumer identity and brand relationship\
  \ (brand loyal, price-driven, values-driven)\n- social media behavior and influence\
  \ (passive consumer, active poster, influencer, non-user)\n- investment and financial\

generation_rationale: "This is a nationally representative US adult population simulation\
  \ focused on political, economic, and cultural fault lines. Here's my reasoning\
  \ for each design choice:\n\n**Average Degree (12):** General consumer/citizen population\
  \ with moderate social connectivity. Americans have ~10-15 meaningful social contacts\
  \ on average. This captures neighborhood friends, coworkers, family-adjacent contacts,\
  \ and community ties without over-connecting.\n\n**Attribute Weights:**\n1. **urban_rural\
  \ (3.5)** \u2013 The single strongest driver of who you know. Rural, suburban, and\
  \ urban Americans live in fundamentally different social ecosystems with little\
  \ cross-over. Also proxies commute patterns, church vs. bar culture, etc.\n2. **us_region\
  \ (3.0)** \u2013 Regional identity shapes social circles deeply. Northeasterners\
  \ and Southerners rarely know each other organically.\n3. **political_identity (3.0)**\
  \ \u2013 Political homophily is one of the strongest documented social sorting forces\
  \ in modern America. People self-select neighborhoods, churches, and friend groups\
  \ by politics.\n4. **education_level (2.5)** \u2013 Educational attainment strongly\
  \ predicts social circle composition (college-educated people disproportionately\
  \ befriend other college-educated people).\n5. **religious_engagement (2.5)** \u2013\
  \ Church is one of the primary community-forming institutions in America, especially\
  \ outside urban cores. Devout people form dense church-based networks.\n6. **employment_sector\
  \ (2.0)** \u2013 Coworkers form natural social bonds. Government workers know government\
  \ workers; gig workers are more isolated.\n7. **age (2.0)** \u2013 Age homophily\
  \ is strong \u2014 people form friendships in age-proximate cohorts (school, early\
  \ career, retirement).\n8. **primary_info_source (1.5)** \u2013 Shared media ecosystems\
  \ reflect and reinforce social clustering. People who watch the same cable news\
  \ or follow the same podcasters often share social circles.\n9. **race_ethnicity\
  \ (2.0)** \u2013 Residential segregation and cultural networks mean race/ethnicity\
  \ remains a meaningful predictor of social connection in the US.\n10. **marital_status\
  \ (1.5)** \u2013 Married couples socialize with other married couples; singles gravitate\
  \ toward singles. Life-stage sorting.\n11. **financial_margin (1.5)** \u2013 Economic\
  \ class shapes where you live, what you do for fun, and who you meet. Paycheck-to-paycheck\
  \ people and comfortable savers rarely share social worlds.\n12. **social_media_behavior\
  \ (1.0)** \u2013 Active posters and influencers disproportionately connect with\
  \ other active users; non-users form offline-only networks.\n\n**Degree Multipliers:**\n\
  - Active poster/Influencer: These people have structurally more connections by definition\
  \ \u2014 they maintain large social media followings and offline networks.\n- Highly\
  \ engaged partisan: Political organizers, campaign volunteers, and activists have\
  \ wide networks spanning their community.\n- Self-employed: Business owners must\
  \ maintain broad client/vendor/community networks.\n- Extraversion (high): Extraverts\
  \ genuinely accumulate more social ties \u2014 but we'll proxy this through social_media_behavior\
  \ and engagement_level since we want observable attributes.\n- Religious devout:\
  \ Regular church attendance creates dense community networks.\n- Federal/State government\
  \ workers: Public sector jobs involve community-facing roles and professional networks.\n\
  \n**Edge Types:**\n- Household members (same household_id) \u2192 family\n- Same\
  \ region + same urban/rural + same political identity \u2192 close community (political\
  \ tribe)\n- Same employment sector (non-retired/unemployed) \u2192 coworker/professional\n\
  - Same us_region + same religious_engagement (devout/moderate) \u2192 faith community\n\
  - Same us_region + similar age \u2192 neighbor/community acquaintance\n- Default:\
  \ acquaintance (weak tie)\n\n**Influence Factors:**\n- education_level: Higher education\
  \ \u2192 more epistemic authority in conversations\n- political_engagement_level:\
  \ Highly engaged partisans and activists influence disengaged peers\n- social_media_behavior:\
  \ Active posters/influencers push information asymmetrically to passive consumers\n\
  - household_income: Wealth confers social status and decision-making authority in\
  \ peer groups"
