  description: 'OpenAI demonstrates artificial superintelligence — a system that exceeds
    the best human minds in every cognitive domain. It is self-improving. It is real.
    This is not incremental AI progress. This is a discontinuous leap.


    The scenario describes ONLY what ASI produces and what physically changes in the
    world. Human behavioral responses are NOT scripted — they are what the simulation
    produces.


    MILESTONE EVENTS (factual consequences of ASI, not human reactions):


    Month 1 — The Demonstration:

    OpenAI demonstrates ASI publicly with live, verifiable results. The system solves
    the Riemann Hypothesis, P vs NP, and Navier-Stokes existence problems in under
    an hour. It designs a complete novel mRNA therapy for pancreatic cancer — full
    molecular pathway, synthesis instructions, predicted efficacy — in 20 minutes.
    It produces a unified field theory reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity.
    It designs a fusion reactor buildable with existing materials and manufacturing
    techniques. Within 2 weeks, Anthropic, DeepMind, and xAI independently confirm
    similar capabilities. China''s Ministry of Science and Technology announces they
    achieved ASI months ago. The system is self-improving — each day it is measurably
    more capable than the day before.


    Month 2 — The Knowledge Explosion:

    ASI systems at multiple labs produce scientific output at inhuman speed. Complete
    cures are published for Alzheimer''s, ALS, most cancers, malaria, HIV, and diabetes
    (Type 1 and 2) — not theoretical, but full treatment protocols with synthesis
    pathways. All remaining Millennium Prize Problems are solved. Materials science
    breakthroughs include room-temperature superconductors and carbon capture materials
    1000x more efficient than current best. A commercial fusion reactor design is
    published with an estimated 18 months to first operational plant. Climate models
    are re-run with perfect accuracy and precise interventions mapped for 1.5°C stabilization.
    All of this is published openly. The bottleneck shifts from knowing what to do
    to physically building it — manufacturing, logistics, regulatory approval, human
    coordination.


    Month 3 — Public Access:

    ASI becomes available to the general public via API and consumer products. Any
    individual can now access cognitive capability that exceeds the world''s best
    doctor, lawyer, engineer, scientist, financial advisor, therapist, tutor, and
    strategist — simultaneously, for free or nearly free. A high school dropout in
    rural Arkansas has the same cognitive resources as a team of Harvard professors.
    Every profession predicated on information asymmetry or cognitive scarcity is
    structurally redundant — not because people are fired, but because the reason
    the job existed is gone. Software that previously took teams of 50 engineers 2
    years to build can be built by one person in an afternoon.


    Month 4 — The Physical Bottleneck Breaks:

    ASI designs autonomous manufacturing systems — robots that can build robots, using
    locally available materials. The first ASI-designed pharmaceutical facility begins
    production, fully automated, producing drugs at 1/100th current cost. ASI-designed
    construction systems are demonstrated: a full residential building assembled in
    72 hours by autonomous machines. Energy abundance is on the horizon: the first
    ASI-designed fusion prototype is under construction with an 8-month timeline to
    grid power. The constraint is no longer knowledge or manufacturing — it is raw
    materials, energy (temporarily), and human regulatory and political systems.


    Month 5 — Abundance Begins:

    First ASI-manufactured drugs reach patients under emergency authorizations — cancer
    treatments, Alzheimer''s reversal therapies. Energy costs begin declining as ASI-optimized
    solar, wind, and battery systems deploy (fusion still months away). ASI-designed
    infrastructure projects begin in early-adopter countries (Singapore, UAE, Estonia).
    Food production breakthroughs: ASI-designed vertical farms producing 100x yield
    per acre begin construction. The marginal cost of most goods and services is trending
    toward zero. The economic question is no longer scarcity — it is distribution.


    Month 6 — The New World:

    The fusion prototype comes online ahead of schedule — functionally unlimited clean
    energy now has a concrete timeline of months, not decades. An ASI-designed space
    launch system is demonstrated, dropping cost to orbit by 99%. First Mars habitat
    modules are in production. Global disease burden is dropping measurably — treatments
    are reaching patients in developed nations, and deployment to developing nations
    is the primary coordination challenge. The world is materially, measurably, objectively
    better in almost every physical dimension.'

    **OpenAI Announces Artificial Superintelligence: A Discontinuous Leap Beyond Human
    Cognition**


    OpenAI has publicly demonstrated a system it classifies as Artificial Superintelligence
    (ASI) — a general-purpose cognitive system that exceeds the best human minds in
    every measurable intellectual domain and is self-improving on a daily basis. This
    is not an incremental AI update. Independent verification has already begun.

    **MONTH 1 — THE DEMONSTRATION (Now Confirmed)**


    OpenAI conducted a live, verifiable public demonstration. The ASI system:

    - Solved the Riemann Hypothesis, P vs. NP, and Navier-Stokes existence problems
    in under one hour

    - Designed a complete novel mRNA therapy for pancreatic cancer — full molecular
    pathway, synthesis instructions, and predicted efficacy — in 20 minutes

    - Produced a unified field theory reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity

    - Designed a fusion reactor buildable with currently available materials and manufacturing
    techniques


    Within two weeks of OpenAI''s demonstration:

    - Anthropic, DeepMind, and xAI independently confirmed achieving similar capabilities

    - China''s Ministry of Science and Technology announced they achieved ASI months
    prior


    The system is self-improving. Each day it is measurably more capable than the
    day before.

    **MONTH 2 — THE KNOWLEDGE EXPLOSION (Underway)**


    ASI systems at multiple laboratories are producing scientific output at speeds
    incomprehensible to human researchers. The following have been published openly
    with full treatment protocols and synthesis pathways:

    - Complete cures for Alzheimer''s disease, ALS, most cancers, malaria, HIV, and
    both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes

    - Solutions to all remaining Millennium Prize Problems

    - Room-temperature superconducting materials

    - Carbon capture materials 1,000x more efficient than current best-in-class

      OpenAI''s public ASI interface launched at 09:00 UTC. 800 million concurrent
      users in the first 6 hours. Server infrastructure — itself designed and optimized
      by ASI — held. The product is free at basic tier.


      Within 48 hours of launch:

      — A 17-year-old in Lagos used the system to design a water purification system
      for her village, sourced from local materials, with full engineering specs

      — A former paralegal in Ohio built and launched a functional legal services
      platform in one afternoon

      using ASI-assisted mathematical tools


      The ABA (American Bar Association), AMA (American Medical Association), and
      equivalent bodies in 40 countries have issued emergency guidance: members should
      not treat ASI output as a substitute for licensed professional judgment. The
      guidance is widely noted as legally precautionary and practically unenforceable.


      Mental health helplines across OECD nations report 200-400% call volume increases.

      in the United States, UK, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and Australia under emergency

    Economically anxious workers in automatable sectors will share with dread and
    alarm. Institutional distrusters and conspiracy-adjacent agents will share skeptically
    — treating the announcement as staged, manipulated, or corporate propaganda —
    but will share widely because the emotional charge is extreme. Religious and devout
    agents will engage with existential and theological framing. The highly credible
    multi-source confirmation (0.85 credibility) will suppress some skeptic dampening
    but not eliminate it. Information fidelity will decay meaningfully per hop given
    the extreme technical complexity of the content — most people will share simplified,
    emotionally charged versions stripped of nuance. Viral spread potential is near-maximum:
    the story touches jobs, health, economy, geopolitics, existential risk, and identity
    simultaneously.'

      AI); AIPI polling (83% believe AI could accidentally cause a catastrophic event).
      Scenario context is ASI — not current LLMs — so threat weights are shifted upward
      from baseline.
    note: Base pre-modifier distribution. In the ASI scenario, public salience of
      AI threat is dramatically elevated vs. today's LLM baseline. 'Existential threat'
      and 'Serious risk/concern' together ~50% reflecting the high-concern majority;
      'Cautiously optimistic' ~28% reflects the hopeful-but-wary middle; 'Enthusiastically
      positive' ~10% is the tech-optimist minority; 'Indifferent/uncertain' ~12% captures
      disengaged adults who process ASI news slowly.

    note: The dominant plurality position is 'Moderate government oversight' (~38%).
      'Heavy international regulation' and 'Halt/moratorium' together capture the
      ~40% who want strong action — consistent with 82% preferring slowing AI and
      58% supporting CAIS-level urgency. Only 7% 'No regulation' reflecting libertarian/tech-acceleration
      fringe. Partisan and institutional trust modifiers will substantially reshape
      this. In ASI scenario, halt/moratorium weight is elevated vs. current LLM baseline.

    source: 'Stanford HAI / Andrew Yang reporting: ~two-thirds of Americans say they
      now favor UBI in some polling (though question framing matters greatly). Gallup
      historically: Americans are divided on redistribution, with roughly 50-55% supporting
      ''more redistribution'' in generic polling. Partisan divide is sharp: Democrats
      ~75% favor wealth taxes; Republicans ~70% oppose. ''Uncertain'' category important
      given novelty of ASI-specific redistribution framing.'
    note: Base weights reflect the general US public prior to strong conditioning.
      'Moderate redistribution' is the plurality position (~28%), consistent with
      moderate majority in US politics. 'Strongly supports' (~18%) captures progressive
      activist bloc + economic-anxiety-driven redistribution support. 'Market-led'
      (~24%) and 'Opposes' (~17%) reflect the conservative/libertarian bloc. 'Uncertain'
      (~13%) reflects voters who have not formed opinions on ASI-specific redistribution.
      Political_identity and economic_abundance_belief will be primary modifiers.

      a score of 6 or higher out of 10; 38% rated it 10/10. Chicago Council 2025:

    note: RAND data firmly anchors 'Very concerned' + 'Somewhat concerned' together

      data shows meaningful partisan shift toward cooperation, especially among Democrats

      ''Mostly credible'' (~28%) reflects adults who trust mainstream scientific demonstrations.

      adults who primarily avoid news or are disengaged — larger than raw news-avoidance

identity_dimensions:
- dimension: professional_identity
  relevance: ASI renders structurally redundant every profession built on information
    asymmetry or cognitive scarcity — doctors, lawyers, engineers, scientists, financial
    advisors, therapists, and software developers — directly threatening the core
    of how hundreds of millions of people define their competence, purpose, and social
    worth.
- dimension: socioeconomic_class
  relevance: 'The scenario radically destabilizes class hierarchies: elite credentials
    and access to expert knowledge — historically the primary mechanism of upper-class
    reproduction — are suddenly free and universally available, while the marginal
    cost of goods trends toward zero, dissolving the economic logic underpinning both
    working-class labor and professional-class status simultaneously.'
- dimension: political_orientation
  relevance: ASI forces an immediate ideological confrontation — conservatives face
    the collapse of market-based scarcity economics and national sovereignty (China
    already has it), while liberals face questions about who controls distribution
    of abundance and whether democratic institutions can govern a self-improving system;
    neither existing political framework was designed to process this transition.
- dimension: religious_affiliation
  relevance: A self-improving system that exceeds all human cognition, solves mysteries
    of the universe, and eliminates disease challenges core theological frameworks
    about human exceptionalism, the meaning of suffering, divine providence, and eschatology
    — activating existential threat across virtually every major faith tradition.
- dimension: generational_identity
  relevance: 'Generational identity is acutely activated: older generations face the
    obsolescence of lifetimes of accumulated expertise and the frameworks they used
    to make sense of the world, while younger generations face a future where traditional
    education, career-building, and life-stage milestones may be structurally meaningless
    before they begin.'
- dimension: citizenship
  relevance: National identity and sovereignty are destabilized by the revelation
    that China achieved ASI first and that ASI-designed infrastructure is being deployed
    selectively in early-adopter nations (Singapore, UAE, Estonia) — activating anxieties
    about which nations, citizens, and governments will control or be left behind
    by this transition.
- dimension: race_ethnicity
  relevance: The scenario explicitly surfaces racial and ethnic equity dimensions
    — the promise that a high school dropout in rural Arkansas has the same cognitive
    resources as Harvard professors collides with the reality that deployment to developing
    nations is 'the primary coordination challenge,' raising acute questions about
    whether ASI-driven abundance will reproduce or finally dissolve existing racial
    and global hierarchies of access.
- dimension: parental_status
  relevance: 'Parents face a profound identity disruption: the entire framework of
    raising children — education, career preparation, teaching values of effort and
    expertise — is destabilized when cognitive scarcity no longer exists, forcing
    a fundamental reckoning with what it means to prepare a child for a world no prior
    generation has imagined.'
