population_description: 'Nationally representative US adult population (18-80). Must
  capture the demographic, economic, and attitudinal fault lines that drive divergent
  responses to major national events — especially technology disruption, economic
  shocks, cultural controversies, and electoral behavior in the 2026 midterm elections.


  Beyond standard demographics (age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, income, geography),
  prioritize attributes that determine how people process and react to news, make
  decisions under uncertainty, and vote:


  - technology adoption posture and digital literacy (technophobe to early adopter)

  - media ecosystem and primary information sources (cable news, social media, podcasts,
  local news, none)

  - institutional trust (government, corporations, media, science, financial system)

  - financial margin and economic anxiety (savings buffer, debt load, paycheck-to-paycheck
  status)

  - employment sector and job security perception (federal/state government, private
  sector, gig, self-employed, retired)

  - consumer identity and brand relationship (brand loyal, price-driven, values-driven)

  - social media behavior and influence (passive consumer, active poster, influencer,
  non-user)

  - investment and financial literacy (no investments, 401k only, active trader, crypto
  holder)

  - religious engagement and worldview (secular, moderate, devout, denomination)

  - political identity and engagement level (strong partisan, moderate, disengaged,
  single-issue)

  - 2024 presidential vote (Trump, Harris, third party, didn’t vote, not eligible)

  - congressional district competitiveness (safe R, safe D, swing district)

  - midterm turnout propensity (always, sometimes, rarely, never)

  - issue salience for 2026 (economy/jobs, abortion/reproductive rights, immigration,
  democracy/rule of law, healthcare, climate, education, AI/technology)

  - approval of current direction (strongly approve to strongly disapprove)


  Geographic distribution should span urban/suburban/rural across major US regions
  (Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Southwest, West Coast), with realistic correlation
  structure between attributes.'
