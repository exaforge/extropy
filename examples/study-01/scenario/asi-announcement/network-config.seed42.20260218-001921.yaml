generated_from: 10,000 US adults aged 18+ representative of the national population
  by state, age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, and income. Include political
  affiliation, media consumption habits, social media usage, religious affiliation,
  and personality traits. Focus on attributes relevant to opinion formation on national
  policy issues.
generation_rationale: "This is a US national adult population focused on opinion formation\
  \ on policy issues. Key social connection drivers:\n\n1. **State/geography**: People\
  \ in the same state are far more likely to know each other \u2014 local networks,\
  \ shared media markets, community events.\n2. **Urban/rural**: Strong residential\
  \ sorting \u2014 urban, suburban, and rural people tend to socialize within their\
  \ own setting.\n3. **Age**: People form friendships with similarly-aged peers (school\
  \ cohorts, life stage).\n4. **Education level**: Strong homophily driver \u2014\
  \ education shapes social circles, workplaces, and interests.\n5. **Political affiliation**:\
  \ Americans increasingly self-sort politically in social networks (affective polarization\
  \ research).\n6. **Religious affiliation**: Congregations are major social network\
  \ hubs; people know others from church.\n7. **Marital status / has_children**: Life\
  \ stage similarity drives connections (parent networks at schools, etc.).\n8. **Race/ethnicity**:\
  \ Residential and social segregation creates strong same-group homophily.\n9. **Employment\
  \ status**: Shared workplace context.\n10. **Household income**: Economic class\
  \ shapes social circles significantly.\n11. **Social media platforms**: Shared platforms\
  \ enable online connections.\n12. **Occupation**: Professional networks form around\
  \ occupation type.\n\nEdge types:\n- **household_member**: Same household (using\
  \ marital_status + household_size proxy \u2014 but we don't have household_id).\
  \ Use partner_id-based logic. Actually, we can use marital_status == Married/Domestic\
  \ Partnership and same state and same income as a proxy... but the validator rejected\
  \ household_id. We should use `a_marital_status == b_marital_status` or better,\
  \ same state + same household_income (since household members share income in the\
  \ sample data). Actually the cleanest proxy for household: same household_income\
  \ AND same state AND same urban_rural.\n- **close_friend**: Same state + same urban_rural\
  \ + same race_ethnicity + similar age\n- **political_community**: Same political\
  \ affiliation + same state\n- **religious_community**: Same religious affiliation\
  \ + same state\n- **coworker**: Same occupation + same state + same urban_rural\n\
  - **acquaintance**: Default fallback\n\nInfluence factors:\n- Education level (more\
  \ educated \u2192 more influential on policy opinions)\n- Civic engagement (actively\
  \ engaged citizens influence others)\n- Trust in institutions (those who trust and\
  \ participate more shape discourse)\n- Need for cognition (analytical thinkers who\
  \ process information more deeply)\n\nAverage degree: For a general US adult population\
  \ focused on social opinion spread, 8-12 is realistic. I'll use 10.\n\nFor household_member\
  \ edge type: since household_id is not in the available attributes list, I'll proxy\
  \ it using same household_income AND same state AND same urban_rural \u2014 which\
  \ will effectively capture actual household members from the sample (agents 0&1\
  \ share household_income=46464, NY, Suburban; agents 3&4 share 100878, SC, Suburban)."
