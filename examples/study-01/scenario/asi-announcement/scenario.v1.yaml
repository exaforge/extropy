  description: 'OpenAI demonstrates artificial superintelligence — a system that exceeds
    the best human minds in every cognitive domain. It is self-improving. It is real.
    This is not incremental AI progress. This is a discontinuous leap.


    The scenario describes ONLY what ASI produces and what physically changes in the
    world. Human behavioral responses are NOT scripted — they are what the simulation
    produces.


    SIMULATION PARAMETERS: 6 timesteps, each timestep = 1 month. Total duration: 6
    months.


    MILESTONE EVENTS (factual consequences of ASI, not human reactions):


    Month 1 — The Demonstration:

    OpenAI demonstrates ASI publicly with live, verifiable results. The system solves
    the Riemann Hypothesis, P vs NP, and Navier-Stokes existence problems in under
    an hour. It designs a complete novel mRNA therapy for pancreatic cancer — full
    molecular pathway, synthesis instructions, predicted efficacy — in 20 minutes.
    It produces a unified field theory reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity.
    It designs a fusion reactor buildable with existing materials and manufacturing
    techniques. Within 2 weeks, Anthropic, DeepMind, and xAI independently confirm
    similar capabilities. China''s Ministry of Science and Technology announces they
    achieved ASI months ago. The system is self-improving — each day it is measurably
    more capable than the day before.


    Month 2 — The Knowledge Explosion:

    ASI systems at multiple labs produce scientific output at inhuman speed. Complete
    cures are published for Alzheimer''s, ALS, most cancers, malaria, HIV, and diabetes
    (Type 1 and 2) — not theoretical, but full treatment protocols with synthesis
    pathways. All remaining Millennium Prize Problems are solved. Materials science
    breakthroughs include room-temperature superconductors and carbon capture materials
    1000x more efficient than current best. A commercial fusion reactor design is
    published with an estimated 18 months to first operational plant. Climate models
    are re-run with perfect accuracy and precise interventions mapped for 1.5°C stabilization.
    All of this is published openly. The bottleneck shifts from knowing what to do
    to physically building it — manufacturing, logistics, regulatory approval, human
    coordination.


    Month 3 — Public Access:

    ASI becomes available to the general public via API and consumer products. Any
    individual can now access cognitive capability that exceeds the world''s best
    doctor, lawyer, engineer, scientist, financial advisor, therapist, tutor, and
    strategist — simultaneously, for free or nearly free. A high school dropout in
    rural Arkansas has the same cognitive resources as a team of Harvard professors.
    Every profession predicated on information asymmetry or cognitive scarcity is
    structurally redundant — not because people are fired, but because the reason
    the job existed is gone. Software that previously took teams of 50 engineers 2
    years to build can be built by one person in an afternoon.


    Month 4 — The Physical Bottleneck Breaks:

    ASI designs autonomous manufacturing systems — robots that can build robots, using
    locally available materials. The first ASI-designed pharmaceutical facility begins
    production, fully automated, producing drugs at 1/100th current cost. ASI-designed
    construction systems are demonstrated: a full residential building assembled in
    72 hours by autonomous machines. Energy abundance is on the horizon: the first
    ASI-designed fusion prototype is under construction with an 8-month timeline to
    grid power. The constraint is no longer knowledge or manufacturing — it is raw
    materials, energy (temporarily), and human regulatory and political systems.


    Month 5 — Abundance Begins:

    First ASI-manufactured drugs reach patients under emergency authorizations — cancer
    treatments, Alzheimer''s reversal therapies. Energy costs begin declining as ASI-optimized
    solar, wind, and battery systems deploy (fusion still months away). ASI-designed
    infrastructure projects begin in early-adopter countries (Singapore, UAE, Estonia).
    Food production breakthroughs: ASI-designed vertical farms producing 100x yield
    per acre begin construction. The marginal cost of most goods and services is trending
    toward zero. The economic question is no longer scarcity — it is distribution.


    Month 6 — The New World:

    The fusion prototype comes online ahead of schedule — functionally unlimited clean
    energy now has a concrete timeline of months, not decades. An ASI-designed space
    launch system is demonstrated, dropping cost to orbit by 99%. First Mars habitat
    modules are in production. Global disease burden is dropping measurably — treatments
    are reaching patients in developed nations, and deployment to developing nations
    is the primary coordination challenge. The world is materially, measurably, objectively
    better in almost every physical dimension.'

    **MONTH 2 — THE KNOWLEDGE EXPLOSION**

    ASI systems across multiple labs are producing scientific output at inhuman speed.
    Complete cures — not theoretical, but full treatment protocols with synthesis
    pathways — have been published for Alzheimer''s disease, ALS, most cancers, malaria,
    HIV, and both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. All remaining Millennium Prize Problems
    have been solved. Materials science breakthroughs include room-temperature superconductors

  description: The ASI announcement originates from a highly credible multi-source
    broadcast (OpenAI corroborated by Anthropic, DeepMind, xAI, and China's Ministry
    of Science and Technology), triggering an initial broadcast phase where agents
    encounter the news through their primary media channels and social media feeds.
    This is followed by a secondary direct_conversation phase where agents discuss
    the implications one-on-one and in small groups — with colleagues in tech, policy,
    and academia driving high-engagement deliberation, while family and friend networks
    process the emotional and existential dimensions. The announcement's extraordinary
    nature (ASI is a civilizational-level event) drives high share probability, with
    amplification among high-openness, high-neuroticism, and tech-adjacent individuals,
    and moderation among low-trust and high-skepticism segments. Political affiliation,
    news outlet lean, and social media usage significantly shape how agents interpret
    and relay the information.

identity_dimensions:
- dimension: professional_identity
  relevance: ASI renders every profession built on information asymmetry or cognitive
    scarcity structurally redundant — doctors, lawyers, engineers, scientists, financial
    advisors, therapists, and software engineers face an existential challenge to
    the very reason their expertise holds value and identity meaning.
- dimension: socioeconomic_class
  relevance: The collapse of marginal costs and the democratization of cognitive resources
    radically disrupts class structures tied to credential access and economic scarcity;
    wealthy and credentialed classes lose the informational advantages that sustained
    their status, while working-class identity faces upheaval as labor markets transform.
- dimension: political_orientation
  relevance: ASI forces immediate confrontation with ideological fault lines around
    regulation, corporate power, state control, redistribution of abundance, and the
    role of government — conservatives and liberals will diverge sharply on who controls
    ASI, how abundance is distributed, and what institutional authority means in a
    post-scarcity world.
- dimension: religious_affiliation
  relevance: A self-improving system that exceeds all human cognition, solves the
    deepest mysteries of the universe, and conquers disease and death challenges foundational
    religious narratives about human uniqueness, divine purpose, mortality, and the
    nature of creation itself.
- dimension: generational_identity
  relevance: Older generations whose entire life frameworks — careers, accumulated
    expertise, institutional trust, and worldviews — were built under cognitive scarcity
    face profound disorientation, while younger generations may experience the disruption
    as liberation or existential uncertainty about what a human life is even for.
- dimension: citizenship
  relevance: National identity and sovereignty are destabilized as ASI capabilities
    concentrate in specific countries (US, China), early-adopter nations (Singapore,
    UAE, Estonia) gain asymmetric advantages, and the question of who controls the
    systems shaping global civilization becomes a matter of geopolitical and national
    identity anxiety.
- dimension: race_ethnicity
  relevance: The promise of equalizing access (a dropout in rural Arkansas equals
    a Harvard team) intersects with historical patterns of unequal technology deployment
    — communities that have been systematically excluded from prior technological
    abundance have reason to be both hopeful and skeptical that this transformation
    will reach them equitably.
- dimension: parental_status
  relevance: Parents face a destabilizing crisis of purpose around education, career
    guidance, and what they are preparing their children for — the entire framework
    of raising children toward productive adulthood is structurally disrupted when
    cognitive labor and credentialed expertise no longer define human value or livelihood.
