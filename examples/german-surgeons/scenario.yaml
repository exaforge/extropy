  content: 'Official notice: Beginning 1 May 2026, the G-BA, in coordination with
    the Bundesärztekammer (BÄK), is introducing a national framework for the clinical
    use and reimbursement of certified AI decision-support systems in surgery. Key
    points: 1) Scope: Applicable to surgical decision-support and workflow tools (e.g.,
    intraoperative imaging analysis, suture/bleeding detection, instrument tracking,
    risk prediction, documentation assistance) used in hospital and MVZ/private practice
    surgical settings across all specialties (general, orthopedic/trauma, visceral,
    cardiac, vascular, neurosurgery, pediatric, plastic, ENT, urology, etc.). 2) Eligibility:
    Only CE-marked devices compliant with EU MDR (Class IIa or higher when applicable)
    and registered in the DiGA/DiPA-like registry for professional AI (new “Pro-KI”
    register) are reimbursable. 3) Reimbursement: New OPS/EBM supplemental codes allow
    billing for validated AI-assisted services; hospitals may claim integration costs
    via KHZF funding lines through 2027. 4) Training: At least 4 CME credit hours
    in AI risk management, bias, and safe use are required for surgeons before billing;
    accredited courses will be available via Landesärztekammern from March 2026. 5)
    Governance: Patient information and consent required for AI involvement in care;
    audit logs must be stored for 10 years; data protection per DSGVO/DSG applies.
    6) Clinical responsibility: AI output is advisory. Final clinical responsibility
    remains with the supervising surgeon. 7) Evaluation: Participating centers must
    report quarterly quality indicators; G-BA will review outcomes and safety annually
    and may adjust codes or indications. 8) Liability and safety: Use only within
    approved indications; documented overrides of AI recommendations are permitted
    and expected where clinically appropriate. 9) Timeline: Voluntary adoption from
    1 May 2026; broader coverage review in Q2 2027. Further details, code lists, and
    the Pro-KI registry link will be circulated to hospitals and practices within
    two weeks.'

  description: The G-BA/BÄK publish the policy via official circulars, journals, and
    society channels. Surgeons first receive/observe the announcement (emails, hospital
    intranet, society newsletters). This triggers follow-up one-on-one and small-group
    discussions within departments, tumor boards, M&M conferences, procurement/IT
    committees, and at CME events. Information flow is anchored by the broadcast but
    refined through peer conversations, especially along mentorship and colleague
    ties.
