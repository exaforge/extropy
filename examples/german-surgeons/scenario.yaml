  content: "Subject: National pilot program to support AI-assisted preoperative planning\
    \ in surgery\n\nThe German Society for Surgery (DGCH), in cooperation with the\
    \ Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) and the Charité–Universitätsmedizin\
    \ Berlin, announces the launch of the 12‑month \"KI-OP-Plan\" pilot program to\
    \ evaluate and support adoption of CE‑marked AI diagnostic decision-support tools\
    \ for surgical planning across multiple specialties.\n\nKey points:\n- Scope:\
    \ AI tools to assist with imaging-based diagnosis, segmentation, risk stratification,\
    \ and structured preoperative planning for general, orthopedics/trauma, visceral,\
    \ vascular, neurosurgery, cardiac, thoracic, pediatric, plastic, urology, and\
    \ gynecologic surgery.\n- Certification: Participating solutions are MDR-certified\
    \ (Class IIa/IIb as applicable) and CE-marked; intended as decision-support for\
    \ licensed physicians, not autonomous decision-makers.\n- Integration: Vendor-agnostic;\
    \ supports DICOM, HL7 v2, and FHIR R4 for PACS/RIS/KIS workflows. On-premises\
    \ or certified German cloud deployment options.\n- Data protection: GDPR-compliant\
    \ processing; patient data remains within the EU. De-identified data may be used\
    \ for model improvement only with explicit institutional approval and patient\
    \ consent according to local policies. Data processing agreements (AVV) and DPIAs\
    \ templates provided. \n- Funding: Up to 80% subsidy on software license fees\
    \ for the first 12 months; integration grant up to €25,000 per site; CME-accredited\
    \ training (20 hours) at no cost for participating surgeons; protected IT implementation\
    \ support.\n- Eligibility: German acute-care hospitals and MVZs with surgical\
    \ departments; priority for sites with existing PACS/KIS integration capabilities\
    \ and data protection officer (DSB) in place. Individual surgeons must be board-certified\
    \ or in advanced training under supervision.\n- Timeline: Application window opens\
    \ 5 January 2026 and closes 31 January 2026; program start 1 March 2026; interim\
    \ evaluation at 6 months; final report Q2 2027.\n- Evaluation metrics: Diagnostic\
    \ accuracy and inter-rater agreement, time-to-plan, case throughput, complication/readmission\
    \ rates, surgical margins (where relevant), user adoption and satisfaction, health\
    \ equity impact across patient subgroups, and cost-effectiveness.\n- Participation\
    \ requirements: Sign participation agreement and AVV; complete onboarding training;\
    \ report predefined quality and safety metrics monthly; maintain human-in-the-loop\
    \ oversight with documented final clinical responsibility by the attending surgeon.\n\
    - Safety and oversight: Local clinical governance with incident reporting to BfArM;\
    \ immediate rollback procedures available; continuous post-market surveillance\
    \ by vendors.\n\nAction required: Interested departments should designate a clinical\
    \ lead and IT contact and submit the online application with a brief implementation\
    \ plan at https://dgch.de/ki-op-plan by 31 January 2026. Questions: ki-op-plan@dgch.de.\n\
    \nThis announcement is distributed to surgical department heads, hospital IT leads,\
    \ and licensed surgeons across Germany via DGCH mailing lists and professional\
    \ chambers."

    (department meetings, MDT boards, OR briefings, WhatsApp/Signal groups, mentor–mentee
    exchanges, and conferences), comparing institutional readiness, medico-legal aspects,
    and workflow integration before deciding whether to adopt or pilot tools.

  extraction_instructions: '- application_intent (required): Look for explicit intent
    words about applying by Jan 31, designating leads, or declining. Map: “we will
    apply/submit” -> will_apply; “likely/interested/considering” -> considering; explicit
    refusal or strong rejection -> will_not_apply; no clear stance -> undecided.

    - sentiment (required): Overall tone toward the program/AI planning from -1 (very
    negative) to +1 (very positive). Consider wording about benefits, risks, enthusiasm,
    skepticism.

    - trust_in_program: Extract confidence in MDR/CE status, BfArM oversight, GDPR
    compliance, human-in-the-loop. Translate praise of safety/governance to higher
    values; doubts about certification, surveillance, or rollback to lower values.

    - perceived_clinical_benefit: If they expect improved accuracy, time-to-plan,
    margins, or outcomes -> high/moderate based on strength; skepticism or no benefit
    -> low; if they say they don’t know -> unclear.

    - information_seeking_behavior: True if they mention visiting the site, emailing,
    requesting demos, scheduling training, or convening an internal meeting; else
    False.

    - integration_readiness: Use statements about DICOM/HL7/FHIR, on-prem/cloud, DPO
    in place, IT bandwidth. Ready_now if they state existing capabilities and few
    barriers; Needs_it_support if feasible but requires IT work or integration grant;
    Lacking_prerequisites if missing key elements (e.g., no PACS integration, no DPO);
    Not_applicable if they state the dept doesn’t do surgical planning or is outside
    scope.

    - main_concern: Capture the most salient concern verbatim or briefly paraphrased
    (e.g., data privacy/AVV/DPIA, costs after subsidy, workflow disruption, liability/final
    responsibility, equity impact, vendor lock-in).'
