  description: 'Adults in Virginia''s 2nd congressional district (Hampton Roads —
    Virginia Beach, Norfolk, Eastern Shore). Demographically representative of a competitive
    swing district with heavy military presence.


    Key population characteristics:

    - Military connection (active duty, veteran, military spouse, defense contractor,
    civilian)

    - Mix of suburban Virginia Beach, urban Norfolk, rural Eastern Shore

    - Racially diverse (significant Black population in Norfolk, white-majority suburbs)

    - Split politically — district went 50.7% R / 49.3% D in 2024


    Beyond standard demographics (age, gender, race, education, income, sub-geography
    within district), prioritize attributes that determine how people process political
    messaging and make voting decisions:

    - Military/veteran status and connection to defense economy

    - Healthcare access and cost burden (VA/Tricare, employer, ACA, uninsured)

    - Political identity, partisanship strength, and 2024 vote

    - Trust in institutions (Congress, VA system, military, media, local government)

    - Issue salience ranking (healthcare, veterans benefits, cost of living, immigration,
    abortion, education)

    - Media diet and primary news sources (local TV, social media, military community
    networks, talk radio, podcasts)

    - Economic security (savings buffer, paycheck-to-paycheck, military pension, dual
    income)

    - Political engagement level (always votes, occasional, checked out)'

    note: Population-level Big Five scores center near 0.5 on a normalized 0-1 scale.
      Openness is slightly lower in this district than national average due to military
      community norms (discipline/tradition-orientation) and rural Eastern Shore population.
      Mean slightly below 0.50 would be realistic (~0.47) but 0.50 is used as conservative
      center. Military populations show modestly lower openness in research literature.

    note: TRICARE/VA share ~32% reflects heavy military/veteran presence — far above
      national ~6%. Employer-sponsored is largest single category for civilians. Uninsured
      ~5% below national average due to military coverage and strong employment. Medicare
      elevated due to retired veteran cohort. Military connection strongly shifts
      toward TRICARE/VA.
